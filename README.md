## Instructions

### About the game
This is a memory card game. To win the game you need to successfully match all the cards.

### How to install
To start the game just open the index.html file.

### How to play

You have 10 minutes to win the game, after this time a Game Over message will show and you'll need to start a new game.
When you click on one card, a symbol will show: you need to find the card with the same symbol to match two selected cards.
If the second card doesn't match the first one, both the cards will be closed.
You can start a new game at any time by clicking the restart button.

While you play, the time has passed, the number of moves and your rating will be shown above the deck.
