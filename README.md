## Instructions

To win the game you need to successfully match all the cards.

You have 10 minutes to win the game, after this time a Game Over message will show and you'll need to start a new game.

To start the game just open the index.html file.

When you click on one card, a symbol will show: you need to find the card with the same symbol to match two selected cards.

If the second card doesn't match the first one, both the cards will be closed.
